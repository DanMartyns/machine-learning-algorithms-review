There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called *classification* and *regression*. 

In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined list of possibilities.  Classification is sometimes separated into *binary classification*, which is the special case of distinguishing between exactly two classes, and *multiclass classification*, which is classification between more than two classes.

For regression tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous number, or a floating-point number in programming terms (or real number in mathematical terms). Predicting a personâ€™s annual income from their education, their age, and where they live is an example of a regression task.
